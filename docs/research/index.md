# Research Overview

Our group investigates the mechanisms that determine the diversity patterns of microbial communities of agricultural and livestock systems. Our work combines molecular biology and bioinformatics to address fundamental challenges in microbial ecology.

## Research Areas

### Area 1: Community genetic diversity as a public good for evolution of innovative functions

Comparative genomics suggests that a large fraction of the metabolic genes present in most bacterial genomes have been horizontally exchanged. The higher number of HGT cases among physiological and overlapping niche-dependent bacteria suggests that ecological interactions are a key factor favoring gene exchange in bacteria. However, most HGT studies have been conducted by analyzing organisms that did not coexist in the exact same habitat, confounding the identification of the putative donor, the time scale of the event, and the functional relevance of the exchange. I believed that a better understanding of the role of ecology in HGT requires a more detailed examination of microbial interactions on a temporal and spatial scale. My previous work suggests that cooperative adaptations (e.g., syntrophism) may be facilitated by HGT, however, how genomes change and adjust to these conditions is unknown. To address how novel functions evolve, I will study the cooperative degradation of newly synthesized chemical compounds (e.g. chlorinated compounds, artificial sweeteners) in different systems (e.g. bioreactor, human microbiomes). Using non-disruptive sampling technologies (e.g. sucrose gradients), stable isotope probing, physicochemical quantification, metagenomics and transcriptomics, my goal is to elucidate the effect of genomic changes in genome diversity that facilitate cooperative interactions. This work will have a direct impact on our understanding of how microbial communities assemble and how interaction within an environment leads to the evolution of functions (metabolic pathways and services).

### Area 2: The genomic basis for cooperation in bacteria

Degradation of most compounds requires the cooperation of phylogenetically unrelated bacteria. While these processes are relevant to understanding how microbial communities assemble and evolve, how recognition and complementation mechanisms arise is unknown. My previous work suggests that cooperative adaptations (e.g., syntrophism) may be facilitated by HGT, however, how genomes change and adjust to these conditions is unknown. To address how these mechanisms evolve, I will study the cooperative degradation of newly synthesized chemical compounds (e.g. chlorinated compounds, artificial sweeteners) in different systems (e.g. bioreactor, human microbiomes). Using non-disruptive sampling technologies, stable isotope probing, physicochemical quantification, metagenomics and transcriptomics, my goal is to elucidate genomic changes that facilitate cooperative interactions. This work will have a direct impact on our understanding of how microbial communities assemble and how interaction within an environment leads to the evolution of functions (metabolic pathways and services).

### Area 3: Tools for exploring fine-level diversity in microbial communities

Sequencing of universal genetic markers, such as the 16S rRNA gene, is the de facto molecular tool for the identification of bacterial composition in studies of microbial communities. However, due to their high conservation, these markers are not suitable for accurately differentiating between more recently diverged lineages and, therefore, the contribution of this diversity remains unknown. Assessment of such fine-level diversity has become ecologically and evolutionarily important, as lineages within the same species may have differences in evolutionary history, gene content, function, and ecology. Exploration of this fine-level diversity has been scarce due to the laborious search and extraction of gene orthologs present in specific taxonomic groups and the difficulty of finding low-redundancy primers that can efficiently amplify the homologous region. To overcome these limitations, we present a python-based application, called PROTÉGÉ (PROTEIN coding genes for high-resolution phylogenetic labeling), which integrates automatic search and extraction of orthologous genes with in-silico design, selection and evaluation of low-degeneracy primers. for high-throughput sequencing.
