### Relationship of cocoa (_Theobroma cacao L._) seed microbial endophyte diversity with germination and grafting of regional materials from Tumaco, Nariño.

!!! info "Ongoing Project"
    **Duration**: 2022 - Present  
    **Funding**: UNAL-AGROSAVIA

This research proposal seeks, first, to explore the differences and similarities of the endophytic communities (fungi and bacteria) of regional materials and universal cocoa rootstocks, in order to determine if there is a relationship between these endophytic communities and grafting success. Second, it seeks to isolate endophytic microorganisms with growth-promoting capacity and evaluate their effect on the grafting success of regional cocoa materials. This knowledge will allow the development of technologies to improve the propagation schemes of materials from the department of Nariño.

### Diversity of the microbiome associated with wild plants of _Theobroma cacao L._ and sister species in the Amazon and Choco regions.

!!! info "Ongoing Project"
    **Duration**: 2022 - Present  
    **Funding**: COLCIENCIAS

In the case of _Theobroma cacao_, very little is known about the composition of the microbial communities associated with the plant under cultivated conditions and there are no reports on the composition under wild conditions. The lack of information on the presence of microorganisms under wild conditions is due to the fact that the parental plants that gave rise to the cultivated cocoa materials were extracted from their natural conditions and subsequently located in other areas of development and production. Therefore, determining the diversity of the cocoa microbiome under an evolutionary framework and under wild conditions offers a unique opportunity to explore, among other topics, the effect of ecosystem diversity on the composition of the cocoa microbiota, the effect of the evolutionary proximity of sister species and genera on the composition of the communities that colonize their tissues, and to determine patterns of coexistence within the microbial communities that can be associated with diseased and healthy tissues in wild and cultivated states.

### Development and evaluation of culture methodologies for the recovery of rumen microorganisms using metabarcoding.

!!! info "Ongoing Project"
    **Duration**: 2022 - Present  
    **Funding**: Max Planck Society

This project seeks to develop a cultivation strategy to improve the recovery of ruminal microorganisms. The strategy combines the evaluation of cultivation parameters with population analysis using metabarcoding. Among the objectives of this project was the evaluation of alternative culture methods for the isolation of rumen microorganisms, this objective was approached from the development of eight culture media, which have been described in the literature as suitable for the recovery of anaerobic microorganisms, in addition to the use of two variables; A dilution variable that has been described as a tool to favor poorly cultured populations and an incubation time variable, trying to represent and benefit the metabolism of microorganisms of slow growth or dependent on metabolites produced by others.
