The higher number of HGT cases among physiological and overlapping niche-dependent bacteria suggests that ecological interactions are a key factor favoring gene exchange in bacteria. However, most HGT studies have been conducted by analyzing organisms that did not coexist in the exact same habitat, confounding the identification of the putative donor, the time scale of the event, and the functional relevance of the exchange. I believed that a better understanding of the role of ecology in HGT requires a more detailed examination of microbial interactions on a temporal and spatial scale. My previous work suggests that cooperative adaptations (e.g., syntrophism) may be facilitated by HGT, however, how genomes change and adjust to these conditions is unknown. To address how novel functions evolve, I will study the cooperative degradation of newly synthesized chemical compounds (e.g. chlorinated compounds, artificial sweeteners) in different systems (e.g. bioreactor, human microbiomes). Using non-disruptive sampling technologies (e.g. sucrose gradients), stable isotope probing, physicochemical quantification, metagenomics and transcriptomics, my goal is to elucidate the effect of genomic changes in genome diversity that facilitate cooperative interactions.

However, due to their high conservation, these markers are not suitable for accurately differentiating between more recently diverged lineages and, therefore, the contribution of this diversity remains unknown. Assessment of such fine-level diversity has become ecologically and evolutionarily important, as lineages within the same species may have differences in evolutionary history, gene content, function, and ecology. Exploration of this fine-level diversity has been scarce due to the laborious search and extraction of gene orthologs present in specific taxonomic groups and the difficulty of finding low-redundancy primers that can efficiently amplify the homologous region. To overcome these limitations, we present a python-based application, called PROT\u00c9G\u00c9 (PROTEIN coding genes for high-resolution phylogenetic labeling), which integrates automatic search and extraction of orthologous genes with in-silico design, selection and evaluation of low-degeneracy primers. for high-throughput sequencing.</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/","title":"Research Projects","text":""},{"location":"research/projects/#current-projects","title":"Current Projects","text":""},{"location":"research/projects/#relationship-of-cocoa-theobroma-cacao-l-seed-microbial-endophyte-diversity-with-germination-and-grafting-of-regional-materials-from-tumaco-narino","title":"Relationship of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) seed microbial endophyte diversity with germination and grafting of regional materials from Tumaco, Nari\u00f1o.","text":"<p>Ongoing Project</p> <p>Duration: 2022 - Present Funding: UNAL-AGROSAVIA</p> <p>This research proposal seeks, first, to explore the differences and similarities of the endophytic communities (fungi and bacteria) of regional materials and universal cocoa rootstocks, in order to determine if there is a relationship between these endophytic communities and grafting success.

The lack of information on the presence of microorganisms under wild conditions is due to the fact that the parental plants that gave rise to the cultivated cocoa materials were extracted from their natural conditions and subsequently located in other areas of development and production. Therefore, determining the diversity of the cocoa microbiome under an evolutionary framework and under wild conditions offers a unique opportunity to explore, among other topics, the effect of ecosystem diversity on the composition of the cocoa microbiota, the effect of the evolutionary proximity of sister species and genera on the composition of the communities that colonize their tissues, and to determine patterns of coexistence within the microbial communities that can be associated with diseased and healthy tissues in wild and cultivated states.</p> <p>Objectives:</p> <ul> <li>Objective 1</li> <li>Objective 2</li> <li>Objective 3</li> </ul> <p>Team Members: [Names]</p>"},{"location":"research/projects/#development-and-evaluation-of-culture-methodologies-for-the-recovery-of-rumen-microorganisms-using-metabarcoding","title":"Development and evaluation of culture methodologies for the recovery of rumen microorganisms using metabarcoding.","text":"<p>Ongoing Project</p> <p>Duration: 2022 - Present Funding: Max Planck Society</p> <p>This project seeks to develop a cultivation strategy to improve the recovery of ruminal microorganisms.
